# Review of Our Experience

Working with three different APIs ([Petstore](/openapi/petstore/), [Museum](/openapi/museum/) and [Train Travel](/openapi/train-travel/)) was an interesting and challenging experience. Each of them has its own unique features and capabilities. What we enjoyed most was learning their functionality and using them to create a our website.

## Perception of information architecture

The process of choosing an architectural solution for information visualization was interesting. After comparing three options - using one sidebar, navbar and catalog, we chose the last option. This made it possible to better structure information and provide convenient navigation for users.

## API comparison experience

We used different criteria when comparing the three APIs. The identified differences and similarities helped us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each API.

## Impressions of working with documentation

Creating contextual documentation for one of the APIs was an interesting challenge. We had never done anything like this before, so it was a new experience for us.

It is also worth mentioning the experience of searching through the RC documentation. After all, we did not cheat and honestly searched for everything that we did not know or did not remember ðŸ˜‡

## What gave you a smile?

All the tasks in which it was necessary to engage the imagination were fun to perform. ðŸ˜ƒ

## What was most confusing?

The most confusing thing for us was that we had to add a changelog.md file for the Museum API to the sidebar, when we decided to use a catalog for this. Therefore, we added all APIs to the sidebar to make it look better.

## General impressions

Overall, the process of developing and interacting with the API was informative.

It was interesting to feel like a real user of the product we are creating.

On our way, we encountered many bugs, which we will definitely describe and send for improvement.
