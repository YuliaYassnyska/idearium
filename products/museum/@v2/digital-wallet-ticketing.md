# Introduction to Digital Wallet Ticketing

## What is Digital Wallet Ticketing?

Digital wallet ticketing allows users to store and manage event tickets on their smartphones using apps like Apple Wallet and Google Pay. This method offers secure, convenient, and eco-friendly ticket management, eliminating the need for physical tickets or QR codes.

## Context: Museum Upgrade to Wallet-Friendly Ticketing

### Project Overview
Our museum is upgrading its ticketing system to support digital wallets. We will:
- Introduce a new API version (`v2`).
- Remove the QR code generation endpoint.
- Add a new endpoint to generate digital tickets for Apple Wallet and Google Pay.
