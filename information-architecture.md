##### Pros:
- all apis in one place as a compact cards with description;
- we have customizable filters to help you find what you need more quickly;
- easy to scale and add a lot of new APIs without a fear of getting mess;
- we can use scorecard inside to check out APIs
- sidebar and navba are not loaded with unnecessary information at the root level
