# Training 12 Debrief

## Top 12 issues

1. **Reunite** and **Realm** names are confusing. Probably rename them to **Cloud Editor** and **Project**.
2. Allow cloning projects locally to enable users to work either with the cloud version or locally simultaneously.
3. Rename **WYSIWYG** in UI and docs to **Live preview**.
4. Add a **green save icon** on top of the Editor with a tooltip that changes to "automatically saved" (Command + S should show this tooltip). Also, show a red icon if the Editor loses connection with the syncer or WYSIWYG, and prompt to restart.
5. Add an explanation of what branches are, why they are needed, and the difference between live preview and deploy builds per branch. Also, probably do not force users to create a new branch at the beginning; just work in the main branch.
6. Highlight visual changes in "Visual preview."
7. Add an image markdown shortcut.
8. Add a description that you cannot merge a PR without approval.
