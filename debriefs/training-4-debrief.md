# Training 4 debrief

We started from reverting our previous training steps.
As we used a remote Git repository created on the first training and connected to our project, it was easier. We have used git to revert our changes but we got an error with WYSIWYG (on main branch) at this stage. See screenshots below:

> on other branches it works correctly :)

Feedback was enabled in `redocly.yaml` without any troubles.
