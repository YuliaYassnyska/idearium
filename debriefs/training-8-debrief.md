# Training 8 debrief

## What was great

- Easy to create folders with API versions.

## What can we improve

- [Docs](https://beta-docs.redocly.com/author/how-to/versions/)
  - The location of the docs could have better location. Instead of `author/how-to/versions`, it would be better to have `open-api/versions`.
  - Add an explanation waht is **versioned content** means
  - It would be good to see some screenshots showing how versions should look.
  - I would change the header **Configure versions** to **Configure versions (optional)**.
  - It would be good to mention that the server URL should be changed manually.

Bugs:

- Visual review is not working if you add a new version.

  Also, you cannot unselect comparing pages, and you will always have at least one blank page with an error.

- The versions picker on mobile looks strange.
