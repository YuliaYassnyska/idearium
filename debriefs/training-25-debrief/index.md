# Training 25 Debrief

## What made you smile?

* it was easy and fast
* Good preparation for documenting the feature

## What did you find confusing?

* Changes inside the ejected components require a full restart of Webview to update.
* Webview takes long to render the project after full restart (>1 minute)
* Half-way during the training, the Webview showed page before the changes.
* After reducing the number of stars, the white space between the stars and the "Was this helpful?" does not change.


## Ideas

* It might be a good idea to show logs or errors when Webview is building the project. This might be helpful when the build itmes are long.
