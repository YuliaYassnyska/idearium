## Project 3 debrief

### Update Realm

It was easy and took less than 3min :)

### Color mode

We have already prepared a logo in two colors in previous training using `srcSet` property, so we skipped this step.
Other colors for headers are perfect in both modes (we checked it :)

### Sell more pets

It was the biggest task but it wasn't so hard. It took over 15 min.
We renamed all tags and relevant words in the openapi definition and changed the name of the `petstore.yaml` file.
We also added the redirect from our old url to the new one to the `redocly.yaml` for changed `petstore.yaml` file.
After that we got two errors with the broken links and successfully resolved it.

### What made you smile?

No smile, it was really serious task :)

### What did you find confusing?

Working with a huge openapi definition file requires being very careful and attentive because you can easily break it and show uncorrect information.
