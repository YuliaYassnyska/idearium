# Training 19 Debrief

## What made you smile?
* The training was really simple and didn’t take much of our time.
* The documentation was helpful and contributed to speeding up the implementation (except for what is described below).
* We even found a small mistake in the OpenAPI definition.
  
{% admonition type="info" %}
**Note**: We did all the implementation locally, not in our editor.
{% /admonition %}

## What did you find confusing?

* We couldn’t figure out the environment variable needed to configure authorization. This was because the documentation wasn’t up to date, and you need to use `$inputs`.
