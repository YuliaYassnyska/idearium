# Training 9 Debrief

## What Was Great

- It was easy to add translation.

## What Can We Improve

- The portal shows an error with an empty locale folder (there should be at least one page).
- We cannot translate time: "X hours ago" and texts from `redocly.yaml`.
- On mobile view, the language picker is confusing.
- Docs: [Predefined translation keys](https://beta-docs.redocly.com/author/reference/translation-keys): `theme.versionPicker.label: "Version :"`. This text should be wrapped in quotes.
