# Training 16 Debrief

## What made you smile?

- We connected GQL docs without using docs. It was intuitive.

## What did you find confusing?

- We have lost uncommitted file during adding remote content
- Webview and whole page basically died when we opened GH REST API. GQL docs were lagging a bit less, but still a lot.
