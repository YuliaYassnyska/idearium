# Training 17 Debrief

## What made you smile?

- Completing this task for 3 hours ðŸ˜…

## What did you find confusing?

- We were not able to complete this training.
- The basic example `operation-sparkle.js` doesn't work. The build is frozen forever ![build.png](./build.png)
- Do you have to run a build in order to debug the plugin? Is there some other simple way?
- Using CommonJS syntax in examples for users may seem that we are using some legacy product.
- After disabling link checks, I still see them in the Webview and during the build:
  ```
  reunite:
    ignoreLinkChecker: true
  ```
- After renaming `i18n`: "Property `l10n` is not expected here. Did you mean: i18n ?"
