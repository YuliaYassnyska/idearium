# README

These are the source files for "OpenAI's Image Generation Guide."

## Structure

- `guide.md` - Contains the documentation for the guide.
- `assets` - A set of images for the guide.
- `curl`, `node`, `python` - Files with code examples for specific programming languages.

## TODO

The `guide.md` file contains "TODO" comments. These TODOs explain how the documentation can be connected to the code samples on a code walkthrough page.

These TODOs are intended as helpers and can be ignored. You can connect the documentation as you see fit. Your primary goal is not to address the TODOs but to migrate the existing OpenAI documentation to Redocly.

## Original Article

Use this [article](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images) as your reference to guide the process. Your goal is to recreate and enhance the reading experience for your customers in Redocly. Aim to further improve the documentation by:

- Using variables to provide real value in your code examples.
- Leveraging the code group feature to combine all examples on one page.
