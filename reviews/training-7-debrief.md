# Training 7 debrief

## What was great

* Easy to add remote content.
* Remote content syncing.

## What can we improve

* We cannot add a remote as a single file ðŸ˜¢.
* Creating remote conent on default branch dosen't triger branch protection modal.
* **Auto-merge** could be enabled without **auto-sync**.
* The **auto-sync** and **auto-merge** descriptions are hard to understand.
  * Can we connect a non-default branch?
  * Do remote syncs only work for Reunite projects?
  * The name Redocly should be replaced by Reunite.

> We suggest keeping **auto-sync** (or maybe **one-way sync**) and replce **auto-merge** with **Create a pull request** (by default disabled).

* It was not simple to find the remote-content docs.
  * For us, [a file structure like this](https://redoc-ly.slack.com/archives/C01D9NU7R4P/p1717765985888739?thread_ts=1717762959.392809&cid=C01D9NU7R4P) would be better (but it's not approved).
  * Add a link to the docs inside the "Connect remote Git" modal.
  * On the "Remote content" page, help icons lead to https://beta-docs.redocly.com/ instead of the remote docs page.
