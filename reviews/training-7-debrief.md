# Training 7 debrief


## What made us smile?

* Remote content syncing.
* Deploy preview after making some changes on remote with PR.

## What did we find confusing?

* We cannot add a remote as a single file.
* The **auto-sync** and **auto-merge** descriptions are hard to understand.
* It was not simple to find the remote-content docs.
