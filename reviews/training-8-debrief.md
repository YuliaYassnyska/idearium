# Training 8 debrief

## What was great

* Easy to create folders with API versions.

## What can we improve

* Docs
  * The location of the docs should be changed. Instead of `author/how-to/versions`, it would be better to have `open-api/versions`.
  * It would be good to see some screenshots showing how versions should look.
  * I would change the headers from **Create subfolders** to **1. Create subfolders** and **Configure versions** to **2. Configure versions (optional)**.
  * It would be good to mention that the server URL should be changed manually.

Bugs:
  * Visual review is not working if you add a new version.

  Also, you cannot unselect comparing pages, and you will always have at least one blank page with an error.

  * The versions picker on mobile looks strange.
