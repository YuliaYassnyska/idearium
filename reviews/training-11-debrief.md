# Training 11 Debrief

- It was difficult to understand how RBAC works for the portal.
- We could not find in the documentation how to grant access for the team. Also, I would expect to have a role `team/Beta Testers` for the team `Beta Testers`. This will help eliminate name collisions like Members and Owners.
- What is the difference between the read, admin, and maintain roles for the portal? You cannot change the content anyway.
